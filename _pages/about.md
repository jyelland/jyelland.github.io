In Rasi's lab, we study the **genetic regulation of protein synthesis**, by developing and using high-throughput tools
to examine messenger RNA and its translation by the ribosome.

I have expertise in the mechanisms and regulation of **translation**, the cellular process through which
all genetic information is translated into functional protein molecules.
I also have a comprehensive array of scientific skills, including microbial genetics, human cell culture and genetics,
cryo-electron microscopy, and many modern and old-school tools for studying the biology of RNA.

I studied at **Oberlin College**,
then obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the **University of Texas at Austin**,
where I was mentored by Arlen Johnson and David Taylor.

As a postdoc, I am building a solid foundation of computational biology skills, learning to analyze and visualize high-throughput sequencing data.
I have become a big fan of **version control**, **tidy data** principles, using **Docker** for code reproducibility, and writing almost everything using **markdown**, **pandoc** and/or **LaTeX**.
Plus, now I can barely type without using **vim** keybindings...
