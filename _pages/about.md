I study the genetic regulation of protein synthesis with Dr. Rasi Subramaniam.

I completed undergraduate studies at Oberlin College,
and obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Texas at Austin,
where I was mentored by Arlen Johnson and David Taylor.

I have expertise in the mechanisms and regulation of *translation*, the process by which
genetic information is translated into functional protein molecules.
I also have experimental skills in microbial genetics, human cell culture and genetics,
cryo-electron microscopy and many modern and old-school tools for studying RNA biology.

I am now building a solid foundation of computational biology skills.
