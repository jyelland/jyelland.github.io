In Rasi's lab, I study the genetic regulation of cellular protein synthesis,
using CRISPR to examine thousands of genes for their ability to control the synthesis and translation of messenger RNA.

My primary expertise is in the mechanisms and regulation of **translation**, the cellular process through which
all genetic information is translated into functional protein molecules.
I have also developed an array of scientific skills, including microbial genetics,
human cell culture and genetics, cryo-electron microscopy, and many modern and old-school tools for studying the biology of RNA.

I studied biochemistry at **Oberlin College**,
then obtained a Ph.D. from the **University of Texas at Austin**,
where I was mentored by [Arlen Johnson](https://arlen002.wixsite.com/johnsonlab) and [David Taylor](https://davidtaylorlab.com/).

In my postdoctoral studies, I am building a solid foundation of computational biology skills, learning to analyze and visualize high-throughput sequencing data.
I have become a big fan of **version control**, **tidy data** principles, using **Docker** for code reproducibility, and writing almost everything using **markdown**, **pandoc**, and/or **LaTeX**.
Plus, now I can barely type without using `vim` keybindings...
