	abstract = {RNA modifications are widespread in biology and abundant in ribosomal RNA. However, the importance of these modifications is not well understood. We show that methylation of a single nucleotide, in the catalytic center of the large subunit, gates ribosome assembly. Massively parallel mutational scanning of the essential nuclear GTPase Nog2 identified important interactions with rRNA, particularly with the 2'-O-methylated A-site base Gm2922. We found that methylation of G2922 is needed for assembly and efficient nuclear export of the large subunit. Critically, we identified single amino acid changes in Nog2 that completely bypass dependence on G2922 methylation and used cryoelectron microscopy to directly visualize how methylation flips Gm2922 into the active site channel of Nog2. This work demonstrates that a single RNA modification is a critical checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that such modifications can play an important role in regulation and assembly of macromolecular machines.},

            Assembly of functional ribosomal subunits and successfully delivering them to the translating pool is a prerequisite for protein synthesis and cell growth. In
            S. cerevisiae,
            the ribosome assembly factor Reh1 binds to pre-60S subunits at a late stage during their cytoplasmic maturation. Previous work shows that the C-terminus of Reh1 inserts into the polypeptide exit tunnel (PET) of the pre-60S subunit. Unlike canonical assembly factors, which associate exclusively with pre-60S subunits, we observed that Reh1 sediments with polysomes in addition to free 60S subunits. We therefore investigated the intriguing possibility that Reh1 remains associated with 60S subunits after the release of the anti-association factor Tif6 and after subunit joining. Here, we show that Reh1-bound nascent 60S subunits associate with 40S subunits to form actively translating ribosomes. Using selective ribosome profiling, we found that Reh1-bound ribosomes populate open reading frames near start codons. Reh1-bound ribosomes are also strongly enriched for initiator tRNA, indicating they are associated with early elongation events. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy to image cycloheximide-arrested Reh1-bound 80S ribosomes, we found that Reh1-bound 80S contain A site peptidyl tRNA, P site tRNA and eIF5A indicating that Reh1 does not dissociate from 60S until early stages of translation elongation. We propose that Reh1 is displaced by the elongating peptide chain. These results identify Reh1 as the last assembly factor released from the nascent 60S subunit during its pioneer round of translation.},

	abstract = {Buchnera aphidicola is an intracellular bacterial symbiont of aphids and maintains a small genome of only 600 kbps. Buchnera is thought to maintain only genes relevant to the symbiosis with its aphid host. Curiously, the Buchnera genome contains gene clusters coding for flagellum basal body structural proteins and for flagellum type III export machinery. These structures have been shown to be highly expressed and present in large numbers on Buchnera cells. No recognizable pathogenicity factors or secreted proteins have been identified in the Buchnera genome, and the relevance of this protein complex to the symbiosis is unknown. Here, we show isolation of Buchnera flagellum basal body proteins from the cellular membrane of Buchnera, confirming the enrichment of flagellum basal body proteins relative to other proteins in the Buchnera proteome. This will facilitate studies of the structure and function of the Buchnera flagellum structure, and its role in this model symbiosis.},
